    TypeScript Tutorial for JavaScript Programmers
    </div>

    <div class="body">
        &emsp;TypeScript is a programming language built strongly off the idea of typing, as you might have guessed.
        When compiled, typescript files are turned into JavaScript files that can be understood by the browser, which makes this language useful for web development.
        TypeScript is also able to communicate directly with your HTML files in order to perform actions on your webpage. 
        As a JavaScript developer, you can think of TypeScript as a more strongly typed JavaScript which can perform the same actions as JS, and then some.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Below is a code example showing a bit of what you can do with TypeScript.
        

      
        <div class="exCode">
            function turnRed() { <br>
                &emsp;   if(document != null){ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; let c = document.getElementById("demo").style.color; <br>
            &emsp;       if(c === 'red'){<br>
            &emsp;&emsp; document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "black";<br>
            &emsp;       }else{<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;  document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;        }<br>
            &emsp;    } <br>   
            &emsp;}

            <h1 id="demo" onclick="turnRed()">Click ME!</h1>
            <script type="module">
                import {turnRed} from '/build/app.js'
                window.turnRed = turnRed;
            </script>
        </div>

        <h2>Types</h2>
       TypeScript is essentially an extension of JavaScript, and thus it knows the language and the types.
        The set of primitive types are as follows: boolean, bigint, null, number, string, symbol, and undefined.
       <h3>Type by Inference</h3>
       One way typing works in TS is by inference, where it looks at the value that was assigned to something and determines what it is.

       <div class="exCode2">
        let name = "John Doe";<br>
        let age = 24;
       </div>
       <br>
       In the examples above, TypeScript looks at the values John Doe and 24,
       and identifies that they are a string and number respectively. 
       This way of typing helps reduce clutter, because you don't need code to 
       explicitly say what the type is.
       
       <h3>Defining Types</h3>
       Inference typing may not always work, such as for creation of objects. 
       To help, TypeScript supports the extension that allows for you to tell TS what the types should be.
       One way to do this is by creating an object with inferred typing, or by using an interface as shown below.
       
       <div class="exCode3">
        interface student {<br>
        &emsp;   name: string;<br>
        &emsp;   grade: number; <br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        const student: Student = {<br>
        &emsp;    name: "John",<br>
        &emsp;    grade: 11,<br>
        };
       </div>

       <h3>Structural Type System</h3>
       In inference typing TypeScript looks at the value assigned, but it can also look at the structure of an object to determine type.
       In this system, if two objects have the same shape, they are inferred to be the same type.
       For example, if an interface us created but the object isn't created by means of the interface. TypeScript looks at the shape of these objects to determine similarity/type.

       <div class="exCode4">
        interface Bank {<br>
        &emsp;   id: string;<br>
        &emsp;   accountNumber: number; <br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        const bank = { id: "johnbank123", accountNumber: 123456789 };<br>
       </div>
       <br>
       In the example above, the code to instantiate the 'bank' variable did not use the 
       interface syntax in the previous example, but since the shape of the interface is the same
       as the object, TypeScript would infer that 'bank' is a Bank object.
